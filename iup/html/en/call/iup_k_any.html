<h2>K_ANY</h2>
<p>Action generated when a keyboard event 
  occurs.</p>
<h3>Callback</h3>
<pre>int function(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, int <strong>c</strong>); [in C]
<strong>elem</strong>:k_any() -&gt; (<strong>ret</strong>: number) [in Lua]</pre>
<p><strong>ih</strong>:
  identifier of the element that activated the event.<br>
<strong>c</strong>:
  identifier of typed key. Please refer to the
  <a href="../attrib/key.html">Keyboard Codes</a>
  table for a list of possible values.</p>
<p><u>Return</u>: If IUP_IGNORE is returned the key is ignored by the system. IUP_CLOSE will be processed. If returns IUP_CONTINUE, the event will be propagated to the parent of the element receiving it 
(<span class="style1">IMPORTANT</span>: Dialog 
  &quot;K_*&quot; callbacks depend on this return value on child control &quot;K_*&quot; callbacks). If returns
  IUP_DEFAULT the key is processed but it is not propagated.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Keyboard callbacks depend on the keyboard usage of the control with the focus. 
</p>
<p>If the callback does not exists it is automatically propagated to the parent of the element.</p>
<h4>K_* callbacks</h4>
<p>All defined keys are also callbacks of any 
  element, called when the respective key is activated. For example: &quot;K_cC&quot; is also a callback activated when the user 
  press Ctrl+C, when the focus is at the element. This is the way an application can create shortcut keys, also called 
  hot keys. These callbacks are not available in IupLua.</p>
<h3>Affects</h3>
<p>All elements with keyboard interaction.</p>
