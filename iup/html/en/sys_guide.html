<h3><a name="init">Initialization</a></h3>
<p>Before running any of IUP&#8217;s functions, function <b>IupOpen</b> must be run to initialize the toolkit.</p>
<p>After running the last IUP function, function <b>IupClose</b> must be run so that the toolkit can free internal memory and close the 
  interface system.</p>
<p>Executing these functions in this order is crucial for the correct functioning of the toolkit.</p>
<p>Between calls to the IupOpen and
  IupClose functions, the application can create dialogs and 
  display them. </p>
<p>Therefore, usually an application employing IUP will have a code in the main function similar to the following:</p>
<pre>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  if (IupOpen(&amp;argc, &amp;argv) == IUP_ERROR)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error Opening IUP.&quot;)
    return;
  }

  ...
  IupMainLoop();
  IupClose();

  return 0;
}</pre>
<h3><a name="led">LED</a></h3>
<p>LED is a dialog-specification language whose purpose is not to be a complete programming 
  language, but rather to make dialog specification simpler than in C. </p>
<p>In LED, attributes and expressions follow this form:</p>
<p>elem = element[<b>attribute1=value1,attribute2=value2,</b>...](...expression...)</p>
<p>The names of the elements must not contain the &#8220;iup&#8221; 
  prefix. Attribute values are always interpreted as strings, but they need to be in quotes (&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;) only when they include 
  spaces. The &#8220;IUP_&#8221; prefix must not be added to the names of 
  the attributes and predefined values. Expressions contain parameters for creating the element.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>In LED there is no distinction between upper and lower case, except for attribute names.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>Though the LED files are text files, there is no way to interpret a text in memory &#8211; there is only the
  IupLoad function, which loads 
  a LED file and creates the IUP elements defined in it. Naturally, the same file cannot be loaded more than once, 
  because the elements would be created again. This file interpretation does not map the elements to the native system.</p>
<p>The LED files are dynamically loaded and must be sent together with the application&#8217;s executable. However, this 
  often becomes an inconvenience. To deal with it, there is the 
<a href="ledc.html">LEDC</a> compiler that creates a C 
  module from the LED contents. </p>
<p>To simply view a LED file objects use the LED viewer application, see <b>IupView</b> in the applications included 
  in the distribution.

<h3><a name="iuplua">IupLua</a></h3>
<p>The Lua Binding is an interface between the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> language and IUP, a portable 
  user-interface system. The main purpose of this package is to provide facilities for constructing IUP dialogs using 
  the Lua language. Abstractions were used to create a programming environment similar to that of object-oriented 
  languages, even though Lua is not one of such languages. The concept of event-oriented programming is broadly used 
  here, because the IUP library is based on this model. Most constructions used in IupLua were strongly based on the 
  corresponding constructions in LED. </p>
<p>In IupLua, attributes and expressions follow this form:</p>
<p>elem = iup.element{...<b>expression</b>...;
    <b>attribute1=value1,attribute2=value2,</b>...}</p>
<p>The names of element creation functions are in lower case, since they are actually constructors of Lua tables. 
</p>
<p>Callbacks can be implemented directly in Lua see <a href="call_guide.html">Events and Callbacks Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Even though there are sintatic sugars used to handle callbacks and attributes in Lua, most of the functions defined 
  in C are exported to Lua, such as IupSetAttribute, IupGetBrother among others.</p>
<p>In IupLua we follow the same organization of the Lua libraries using a namespace 
(&quot;iup&quot;) before all the definitions.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>All exported functions are accessed only through <b>iup.FunctionName</b>, including control 
    initialization like <b>iup.label</b>.</li>
  <li>All callbacks in are accessed through their exact name in the C API. 
  </li>
  <li>Numeric definitions where kept in upper case without the IUP_ prefix, such 
  as <strong>iup.DEFAULT</strong>.</li>
  <li>String definitions for values are no longer supported, always use &quot;YES&quot;, &quot;NO&quot;, &quot;ACENTER&quot;, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>IUP&#8217;s binding for Lua was made <i>a posteriori</i> and completely replaces the LED files. Besides, Lua is a 
  complete language, so a good deal of the application can be implemented with it. However, this means that the 
  application must link its program to the Lua and to the IupLua libraries, as well as the IUP library.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>The Lua files are dynamically loaded and must be sent together with the application&#8217;s executable. However, this 
  often becomes an inconvenience. To deal with it, there is the <b>LuaC</b> compiler that creates a C module from the 
  Lua contents. For example:</p>
<pre>luac -o myfile.lo myfile.lua
bin2c myfile.lo &gt; myfile.loh</pre>
<p>In C, you can used a define to interchanged the use of .LOH files:</p>
<pre>#ifdef _DEBUG
  ret_val = lua_dofile(&quot;myfile.lua&quot;);
#else
#include &quot;myfile.loh&quot;
#endif</pre>
<p>The distribution files include an executable called <b>iuplua51</b>, 
  that you can use to test your Lua code. It has support for all the addicional controls, 
for IM, CD and OpenGL calls. It is
<u1:p> 
  available at the <a href="download.html">Download</a>.</u1:p></p>
<h3><a name="iupluainit">IupLua Initialization</a></h3>
<p>Before running any function from the Lua Binding, you must run the <b>iuplua_open</b> function to initialize the toolkit. This 
  function should be run after a call to function <b>IupOpen</b>. 
  All this is done in C in Lua&#8217;s host program.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  IupOpen(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
  IupControlsOpen();

  /* Lua 5 initialization */
  L = lua_open();   
  luaL_openlibs(L);

  <span class="style1"><strong>iuplua_open(L);</strong></span>      /* Initialize Binding Lua */
  <strong><span class="style1">iupcontrolslua_open(L);</span></strong> /* Initialize additional controls binding Lua */

  /* do other things, like running a lua script */
  lua_dofile(L, &quot;myfile.lua&quot;);

  IupMainLoop(); /* could be here or inside &quot;myfile.lua&quot; */

  lua_close(L);

  IupClose();

  return 0;
}</pre>
<p>See the example <a href="../examples/func/iuplua51_init.c">iuplua51_init.c</a> for Lua 5.1.</p>
<p>It is also allowed to call <b>iuplua_open</b> without calling <b>IupOpen</b>. Then 
<b>IupOpen</b> 
  will be internally called. This enable you to dynamically load IUP using Lua 5 &quot;loadlib&quot;. This is also valid for all 
  the additional controls when IUP is&nbsp; dynamically loaded. To call <b>IupClose</b> in this way you must call 
<b>iuplua_close</b>.</p>
<p>Here is an example on how to dynamically load IUP in Lua 5.1:</p>
<pre>local iuplua_open = package.loadlib(&quot;iuplua51.dll&quot;, &quot;iuplua_open&quot;)
iuplua_open()
local iupcontrolslua_open = package.loadlib(&quot;iupluacontrols51.dll&quot;, &quot;iupcontrolslua_open&quot;)
iupcontrolslua_open() </pre>
<p><strong>Lua</strong> 5.1 &quot;require&quot; can be used for all the <strong>
IupLua</strong> 
libraries. You can use <b>require</b>&quot;<b>iuplua</b>&quot; and so on, but the LUA_CPATH 
must also contains the following: </p>

<pre>"./lib?51.so;"    [in UNIX]

".\\?51.dll;"     [in Windows]</pre>
<p>The LuaBinaries distribution already includes these modifications on the 
default search path.</p>
<p>The simplest form <b>require</b>&quot;<b>iup</b>&quot; 
and so on, can not be used because there are IUP dynamic libraries with names 
that will conflict with the names used by <b>require</b> during search.</p>
<p>When using <strong>require</strong> the Iup initialization functions are not necessary. The 
initialization is automatically done inside the Lua initialization function 
during require.</p>
