<h2>IupClose</h2>
<p>Ends the IUP toolkit and releases internal 
  memory. It will also automatically destroy all dialogs and all elements that 
have names.</p>
<h3>
Parameters/Return</h3>
<pre>void IupClose(void); [in C]
iup.Close() [in Lua]</pre>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>In Windows, the CoUninitialize function is called.</p>
<p>In Motif, the XtDestroyApplicationContext function is called.</p>
<p>This function is usually called by the 
  application to match the call to <strong>IupOpen</strong>. </p>
<p>When the Lua binding is used, and IUP is dynamically loaded then you should call 
<b>iup.Close</b> from Lua. If IUP is statically loaded and <strong>iuplua_open</strong> 
was called, then you should call <strong>iuplua_close</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>
iuplua_close</strong> will destroy all dialogs and all elements that have names that where 
created with the same Lua context before <strong>IupClose</strong> is actually 
called (since 3.31).</p>
