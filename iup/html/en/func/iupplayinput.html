<h2>IupPlayInput</h2>
<p>Reproduces all mouse and keyboard input from a given file.</p>
<h3>
Parameters/Return</h3>
<pre>int IupPlayInput(const char *<strong>filename</strong>); [in C]
iup.PlayInput(<strong>filename</strong>: string) -&gt; <strong>ret</strong>: number [in Lua]</pre>
<p><strong>filename</strong>: name of the file to be played. NULL will stop 
playing. &quot;&quot; will pause and restart a file already being played.</p>
<p><span class="style1">Returns:</span> IUP_NOERROR if successful, IUP_ERROR if 
failed to open the file for writing. If already playing</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The file must had been saved using the <strong>IupRecordInput</strong> 
function. Record mode will be automatically detected.</p>
<p>This function will start the play and return the control to the application. 
If the file ends all internal memory used to play the file will be automatically 
released.</p>
<p>It uses the MOUSEBUTTON global attribute to reproduce the events. See the 
documentation of this attribute for further details and current limitations. As 
an attempt to workaround system limitations in MOUSEBUTTON record the file using 
IUP_RECSYSTEM.</p>
<p>The file must had been generated in the same operating system. Screen size 
differences can exist, but if different themes are used then mouse precision 
will be affected.</p>
