IUP 2.x to IUP 3.x</h2>

<h3>Critical Changes (from 2.x to 2.7/3.0)</h3>

<p>All critical changes were packed in version 2.7 so you can
prepare your code to work with both 2.7 and 3.0 versions. And you will
be able to alternate between both versions without having to add
"ifdef"s to your code. The differences in the "iup.h" header file from
2.7 to 3.0 should&nbsp;contains only the new features introduced in
3.0.</p>

<p><b style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IupOpen</b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> function declaration now
include command line arguments used by X-Windows and GTK</span> -
The most important change is the signature of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">IupOpen</span> function. It
was changed to include the main function arguments. The GTK and Motif
toolkits use them. In IUP prior to version 2.7 they were ignored for
Motif. In Windows they are always ignored. If for some reason you do
not have access to the main function arguments you can use NULL in
IupOpen. As a general rule the change is:</p>

<pre>IupOpen()&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; IupOpen(&amp;argc,&amp;argv)</pre>

<p>You will also have to search&amp;replace a few things in
your source code:<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span></p>

<pre>the attribute<span style="">&nbsp;</span>"WIN_SAVEBITS"<span style="">&nbsp; &gt;&gt;</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>"SAVEUNDER"<br>the function IupGetType<span style="">&nbsp;</span> &gt;&gt;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>IupGetClassName</pre>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">&nbsp;Although
the following were considered obsolete in IUP 2.6, their backward
compatibility code were removed in 2.7. So you may have to&nbsp;</span>search&amp;replace
for:</p>

<pre><span style=""></span>the attributes <span style=""></span>"MOTIF_FONT" and "WINFONT"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&gt;&gt;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"FONT"<br><span style="">the v</span>alue of the attribute "CURSOR" =<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"IUP"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;</span>&gt;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"HELP"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span>the definition IUP_ANYWHERE<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span>&gt;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>IUP_CURRENT<br>the constructor IupColor<span style="">&nbsp;</span>(removed) <span style="">&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>use the color value</pre>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The "cdiup"
and "cdluaiup" libraries moved from CD to IUP under the name "iupcd"
and "iupluacd" </span>- Also you will have to change your
makefile or IDE project because we changed some library names to solve
the cross dependencies between IUP, CD and IM libraries.</p>

<h3>Strategic Changes (from 2.7 to 3.0)</h3>

<p>All the changes described here are backward compatible with
2.7. So after doing them you will still be able to go back to 2.7.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The
following headers were deprecated iupcb.h, iupcells.h, iupcolorbar.h,
iupdial.h, iupgauge.h, iupmatrix.h, iuptree.h</span> - they now
simply include iupcontrols.h. You can replace them by iupcontrols.h in
your code.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The
following headers were deprecated iupcbox.h, iupsbox.h, iupgetparam.h,
iupspin.h, iuptabs.h, iupval.h</span> -&nbsp;they now simply
include iup.h. You can remove them from your code.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The ACTION
callback in </span><strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IupText</strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">/</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IupMultiline</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> now does NOT process
extended keys anymore</span> - the callback is called only if the
text is edited, and key=0 if it is not a valid character. In 2.x the
key parameter were used for some navigation keys, but now is used only
for keys associated with characters. This is the most impacting change
from 2.7 to 3.0, because some functionality in your application could
stop working. Use the K_ANY or K_* callbacks instead to process
navigation keys.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The Natural
Size of </span><strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IupText</strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">/</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IupMultiline</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> does not uses the text
contents anymore</span> - to control the Natural Size use the
SIZE/RASTERSIZE attributes, or the VISIBLECOLUMNS/VISIBLELINES
attributes, or the EXPAND attribute.&nbsp;This will avoid the
automatic resize of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">IupText/IupMultiline</span>
if its content is changed by the user and the size of the dialog is
changed so the layout is recalculated.</p>

<p>Now in <span style="font-weight: bold;">IupCanvas</span>
the scrollbar parameters X/YMIN, X/YMAX and X/YLINE are updated only
when DX/Y are updated. POSX/Y&nbsp;will only update the position of
the scrollbar. In version 2.x was necessary to set POSX/Y to update
those parameters.</p>

<p>The BGCOLOR attribute is now ignored in <strong>IupLabel</strong>,
<strong>IupFrame</strong>, <strong>IupToggle</strong>
(for the text background) and <strong>IupVal</strong>.
They will use the background color of the native parent.</p>
<p><span class="style1">The <strong>IupItem</strong> in GTK must have its VALUE 
attribute defined (ON or OFF) before mapping</span> - so it can have the check 
mark, or define HIDEMARK=NO. If not done the item will not be checkable.</p>
    <p>
        The new IupTabs does not supports the inactive tab feedback. So the tabs will be
        always active, although its children will be sucessfully disabled. The return value
        of the TABCHANGE_CB callback is not processed anymore.</p>

<p>In <strong>IupMatrix</strong> if the last column is not completely visible, 
then adjust the matrix size manually or let the natural size adjust it for you 
using NUMCOL_VISIBLE_LAST=YES and NUMLIN_VISIBLE_LAST=YES.</p>

<p><span class="style1">In <strong>IupTree</strong> DEPTH is now a read-only attribute, 
use the INSERT* attributes to properly add nodes.</span> <span class="style1">
The SELECTION_CB and MULTISELECTION_CB callbacks now ignore their return value.
</span>NAMEid attribute renamed to TITLE, old attribute still works but will be 
	removed in future versions. </p>

<h3>Deprecated Controls <span class="style2">(will be removed in a future 
version)</span> </h3>

<p>The controls <strong>IupGauge</strong>, <strong>IupTabs</strong> and <strong>
IupVal</strong> based on the CD library were replaced by native controls in IUP 
3.0. But not all features of the old controls are available in the new controls, 
so the old ones are still available until the applications have the chance to 
migrate them to the new ones. In a future version the old ones will be 
completely removed from IUP.</p>
<p>The <strong>IupGauge</strong> was superseded by <strong>IupProgressBar</strong>. 
The new control does NOT supports the display of a text inside the progress bar 
area. If you use the text in the <strong>IupGauge</strong> you will have to add 
a label on top or bottom of the progress bar to obtain a similar result. A less 
critical change is the DASHED attribute which has limited support in the <strong>
IupProgressBar</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>IupTabs</strong> was moved to the main library under the same 
name because the new one almost have all the features of the old one.
<span class="style1">The most impacting feature is the TABORIENTATION attribute 
that has limited support in the native controls.</span></p>

<p>The <strong>IupVal</strong> follows the same idea. The only feature that it 
is not available is the use of a custom handler image.</p>
