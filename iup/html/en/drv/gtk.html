<h2>GTK System Driver<span class="style1"> (since 3.0)</span></h2>
<p>This driver was designed for the GTK+ 
  version 2. It can be compiled in Windows or UNIX.</p>
<p>Although GTK has layout elements they are not used. IUP fill, vbox, hbox and 
zbox containers are implemented independent from the native system.</p>
<p>The oldest GTK version that can be used is 2.4, oldest versions will not 
compile. But using versions older than 2.12 several features will not work. 
Critical features need at least version 2.8.</p>
<p>Currently it is not available for IRIX, AIX and SunOS. But is it available 
for SunOS10 and it is not available for Linux24.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<h4>Dependencies</h4>
<p>GTK is in fact composed of several libraries. The GTK package contains the 
GDK library and depends on the ATK, Cairo, Glib and Pango libraries.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>

<p>The GTK driver can be compiled and used in Windows, but it is not recommended since it is slower and 
much more memory 
  consuming than the IUP native Windows driver.</p>
<p>When using DLLs in Windows, the &quot;iup.dll&quot; uses the Win32 driver. So 
applications that dynamically load IUP will always use the &quot;iup.dll&quot;, for 
example Lua using require. To use the IUP GTK dll in Windows you must rename the 
&quot;iupgtk.dll&quot; to &quot;iup.dll&quot;, so the GTK driver will be loaded instead of the Win32 
driver.</p>
<h4>MacOSX</h4>
<p>The GTK driver also compiles in MacOSX with the new GTK port available at
<a href="http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/">http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/</a>. 
But the <strong>IupGLCanvas</strong> is not available yet, you must use the GDK base driver of 
the CD library and some elements like <strong>IupTree</strong> are not 100% functional. The 
installation of gtk-osx is quite complex because there are no pre-compiled 
binaries. Also if the MacOSX theme is used several controls have problems. We hope that this will improve in the future. 
Must define GTK_MAC in the config.mak makefile to enable this build.</p>
<p>So for now we are distributing binaries that use the X11 version of GTK 2.16. 
They were installed using <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a>.</p>
<h4>UTF-8</h4>
<p>GTK uses UTF-8 as its charset for all displayed text, so IUP will 
automatically convert all strings to (SetAttribute) and from (GetAttribute) 
UTF-8. To use UTF-8 strings set the global attribute UTF8AUTOCONVERT to NO.</p>
