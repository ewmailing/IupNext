<h3><a name="start">Getting Started</a></h3>
<p>IUP has four impor<u1:p>tant concepts that are implemented in a very different way from other toolkits. 
</u1:p>
</p>
<p>
<u1:p>First is the control creation timeline. When a control is created it is not immediately mapped to the native 
  system. So some attributes will not work until the control is mapped. The mapping is done when the dialog is shown or 
  manually calling <b>IupMap</b> for the dialog. You can not map a control without inserting it into a dialog.</u1:p></p>
<p>Second is the attribute system. IUP has only a few functions because it uses string attributes to access the 
  properties of each control. So get used to <b>IupSetAttribute</b> and <b>IupGetAttribute</b>, because you are going to 
  use them a lot.</p>
<p>Third is the abstract layout positioning. IUP controls are never positioned in a specific (x,y) coordinate inside 
  the dialog. The positioning is always calculated dynamically from the abstract layout hierarchy. So get used to the 
<b>IupFill</b>, <b>IupHbox</b> and <b>IupVbox</b> controls that allows you to position the controls in the dialog.</p>
<p>Fourth is the callback system. Because of the LED resource files IUP has an indirect form to associate a callback 
  to a control. You associate a C function with a name using <b>IupSetFunction</b>, and then associate the callback 
  attribute with that name using <b>IupSetAttribute</b>. But applications now should use the 
<b>IupSetCallback</b> 
  function to directly associate a callback for a control.&nbsp; </p>
<p>LED is the original IUP resource file which has been deprecated in favor of Lua files. But keep in mind that you 
<u>can</u> use IUP without using LED or Lua, using only the C API.</p>
<h3><a name="apl">Building Applications</a></h3>
<p>To compile programs in C, simply include file <b>iup.h</b>. If the application only uses functions from IUP and other portable languages 
  such as C or Lua, with the same prototype for all platforms, then the application immediately becomes platform 
  independent, at least concerning user interface, because the implementation of the IUP functions is different in each 
  platform. The linker is in charge of solving the IUP functions using the library specified in the project/makefile. 
  For further information on how to link your application, please refer to the specific driver documentation.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
</p>
<p>IUP can also work together with other interface toolkits. The main problem is the 
<strong>IupMainLoop</strong> function. If you are 
  going to use only Popup dialogs, then it is very simple. But to use non modal dialogs without the 
<strong>IupMainLoop</strong> you must 
  call <strong>IupLoopStep</strong> from inside your own message loop. Also it is not possible to use Iup controls with dialogs from 
  other toolkits and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The generation of applications is highly dependent on each system, but at least the 
<b>iup</b> 
  library must be linked.</p>
<p>To use the additional controls you will need the 
<b>iupcontrols</b> and <strong>iupcd</strong> libraries and the CD library 
<b>cd</b>.</p>
<p>Other controls are available in secondary libraries, they also may have other 
external dependencies, check the documentation of the control.</p>
<p>To use the Lua Binding, you need to link the program with the <b>iuplua</b> library 
  and with the <b>lua </b>library. The other secondary libraries also have their Lua binding 
libraries that must be linked to use the control in Lua.</p>
<p>The download files list includes the <a href="download_tips.html">Tecgraf/PUC-Rio Library Download Tips</a> 
  document, with a description of all the available binaries.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>In Windows,
  you must link also with the libraries 
  <b>ole32.lib</b>
  and <b>comctl32.lib</b> (provided with the compilers). The <b>iup.rc</b> resource file must be included in the application's project/makefile so that some icons 
  and cursors can be used when not using the DLLs and to enable Windows XP 
Visual Styles. <b>iup.rc</b> is located in 
&quot;/etc&quot; folder of the distribution.</p>
<p>There is also guides for using some IDEs: <a href="ide_guide/cppbx.html">C++ Builder X</a>,&nbsp;
  <a href="ide_guide/dev-cpp.html">Dev-C++</a>,&nbsp; <a href="ide_guide/owc.html">OpenWatcom C++</a>,
  <a href="ide_guide/msvc.html">Visual C++ 7 (Visual Studio 2003)</a>,
  <a href="ide_guide/msvc8.html">Visual C++ 8 (Visual Studio 2005)</a> and <a href="ide_guide/eclipse.html">
Eclipse for  C++</a>.</p>
<h4>Motif</h4>
<p>In Motif, IUP uses the Motif (Xm), the Xtoolkit (Xt) and the Xlib (X11) libraries. To link an application to IUP, use the following options in the linker call 
  (in the same order): </p>
<pre>-liup -lXm -lXmu -lXt -lX11 -lm</pre>
<p>Though these are the minimum requirements, 
  depending on the platform other libraries might be needed. Typically, they are X extensions (Xext), needed in SunOS, and Xpm
  (needed in Linux only). They must be listed 
  after Xt and before X11. For instance: </p>
<pre>-liup -lXm -lXpm -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm</pre>
<p>Usually these libraries are placed in 
  default directories, but you may require additional 
  options: </p>
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <td width="145">Linux</td>
      <td width="434">-L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/X11R6/include</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="145">IRIX</td>
      <td width="434">-L/usr/lib32 (X11)<br>
		-L/usr/Motif-2.1/lib32 -I/usr/Motif-2.1/include (Motif)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="145">SunOS</td>
      <td width="434">-L/usr/openwin/lib -I/usr/openwin/share/include (X11)<br>
		-L/usr/dt/lib -I/usr/dt/share/include (Motif)</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
<h4>GTK+ (since 3.0)</h4>
<p>In UNIX it will need the X-Windows libraries just like the Motif driver. And in UNIX or in Windows it will need the 
  &quot;iupgtk&quot; library and the following GTK+ libraries:</p>
<pre><b>gtk-win32-2.0 gdk-win32-2.0</b> gdk_pixbuf-2.0 pango-1.0 <b>pangowin32-1.0</b> gobject-2.0 gmodule-2.0 glib-2.0
   or
<b>gtk-x11-2.0 gdk-x11-2.0</b> gdk_pixbuf-2.0 pango-1.0 <b>pangox-1.0</b> gobject-2.0 gmodule-2.0 glib-2.0</pre>
<p>In UNIX the following INCLUDES paths are necessary:</p>
<pre>/usr/include/atk-1.0 /usr/include/gtk-2.0 /usr/include/cairo /usr/include/pango-1.0 /usr/include/glib-2.0 
and eventually:   /usr/lib/glib-2.0/include /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/include
             or   /usr/lib64/glib-2.0/include /usr/lib64/gtk-2.0/include</pre>
<h4>Multithread</h4>
<p>User interface is usually not thread safe and IUP is not thread safe. The general recommendation when you want more 
  than one thread is to build the application and the user interface in the main thread, and create secondary threads 
  that communicates with the main thread to update the interface. The secondary threads should not directly update the 
  interface.</p>
<h4>Dynamic Loading</h4>
<p>Although we have dynamic libraries we do not recommend the dynamic loading of the main IUP library in Motif. This 
  is because it depends on Motif and X11, you will have to load these libraries first. So it is easier to build a base 
  application that already includes X11, Motif and the main IUP library than trying to load them all. In Windows this is 
  not a problem.</p>
<p>The IUP secondary libraries can be easily dynamic loaded regarless of the system.</p>
<h3><a name="buildlib">Building The Library</a></h3>
<p>In the Downloads you will ne able to find pre-compiled binaries for many 
platforms, all those binaries were built using Tecmake. Tecmake is a command line multi compiler build tool 
based on GNU make, available at
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake</a>. Tecmake is 
  used by all the Tecgraf libraries and many applications.</p>
<p>In UNIX, you do not need to install Tecmake, a compact version of Tecmake for 
UNIX is already included in the source code package. Just type &quot;make&quot; in the 
command line on the main IUP folder and all libraries and executables will be 
build. Set the TECTOOLS_HOME environment variable to the folder were the CD, IM 
and Lua libraries are installed, by default it will assume 
&quot;TECTOOLS_HOME=../..&quot;.</p>
<p>In Windows, the easiest way to build everything is to install the Tecmake tool into your system. It is easy and helps a lot. 
  The Tecmake configuration files (*.mak) available at the &quot;src*&quot; folders are very easy to understand also. In IUP's<b> </b>main directory, and in each source directory, there are files named 
<i>make_uname.bat</i> that build the libraries using <b>Tecmake</b>. To build for Windows using 
  Visual C 7.0 (2005) for example, just execute <i>&quot;make_uname vc7&quot;</i> in the iup root folder, 
or the DLLs with Visual C++ 9 (2008) type <i>&quot;make_uname dll9&quot;</i>. The Visual 
Studio workspaces with the respective projects available in the source package 
is for debugging purposes only.</p>
<p><b>IUP</b> runs on many different systems and interact with many different libraries such as
  <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/" target="_blank">Motif</a>, 
<a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>,
  <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd" target="_blank">Canvas Draw (CD)</a> and
  <a href="http://www.lua.org" target="_blank">Lua</a>. You have to install some these libraries to 
build the 
  secondary IUP libraries. Make sure you have all the dependencies for the 
library you want installed, see the documentation bellow.</p>
<p>If you are going to build all the libraries, 
the makefiles and projects expect the following directory tree:</p>
<pre>/mylibs/
        iup/
        cd/
        im/
        lua5.1/</pre>
<p>IUP_ASSERT can be defined to enable some runtime checks for the main API.</p>

(*) In Windows, &quot;<strong>iupwin</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>iup</strong>&quot;. 
    In Linux, Darwin and FreeBSD &quot;<strong>iupgtk</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>iup</strong>&quot;. 
    In IRIX, AIX and SunOS &quot;<strong>iupmot</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>iup</strong>&quot;.</pre>

<p>As a general rule (excluding system dependencies): IUP depends on CD and IM, 
and IUPLua depends on Lua, CDLua and IMLua. Notice that not all IUP 
libraries depend on CD and IM.</p>
<p>Instead of building all the libraries, try building only the libraries you 
are going to use. The Makefile on the root folder will build all the libraries, 
but in each source folder there are secondary Makefiles. We use the following 
source code structure:</p>
<pre>iup/
    src/         - The core library. Motif, GTK and Windows code
    srccd/       - CD_IUP canvas driver for the CD library
    srcconsole/  - Lua interpreter executable with pre-loaded IUP, CD and IM libraries
    srcgl/       - IupGLCanvas
    srcim/       - IUP/IM utilities
    srcimglib/   - Image Libraries with Icons, Logos and Bitmaps
    srcledc/     - ledc executable
    srclua3      - Lua3 binding, used at Tecgraf by some old applications
    srclua5/     - Lua 5 binding
    srcole/      - IupOleControl
    srcpplot/    - IupPPlot
    srcview/     - IupView executable</pre>
<p>The Lua bindings for IUP, CD and IM (Makfiles and Pre-compiled binaries) 
depend on the <a href="http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/">LuaBinaries</a> 
distribution. So if you are going to build all use the <strong>LuaBinaries</strong> 
source package also, not the <strong>Lua.org</strong> original source package. 
If you like to use another location for the Lua files overwrite the LUAINC, 
LUALIB and LUABINDIR definitions before using Tecmake or Tecmake Compact.</p>
<p>In Ubuntu you will need to install the following packages and their 
dependencies:</p>
<pre>libmotif-dev
x11proto-print-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev
libgul-mesa-dev
libgtk2.0-dev</pre>
<h3><a name="cpp">Using IUP in C++</a></h3>
<p>IUP is a low level API, but at the same time a very simple and intuitive API. That's why it is implemented in C, to 
  keep the API simple. But most of the actual IUP applications today use C++. To use C callbacks in C++ classes, you can 
  declare the callbacks as static members or friend functions, and store the pointer &quot;this&quot; at the &quot;Ihandle*&quot; pointer as 
  an user attribute. For example, you can create your dialog by inheriting from the following dialog.</p>
<pre>class iupDialog
{
private:
  Ihandle *hDlg;
  int test;

  static int ResizeCB (Ihandle* self, int w, int h); 
  friend int ShowCB(Ihandle *self, int mode); 

public:
  iupDialog(Ihandle* child)
  { 
    hDlg = IupDialog(child); 
    IupSetAttribute(hDlg, &quot;iupDialog&quot;, (char*)this); 
    IupSetCallback(hDlg, &quot;RESIZE_CB&quot;, (Icallback)ResizeCB);
    IupSetCallback(hDlg, &quot;SHOW_CB&quot;, (Icallback)ShowCB);
  }

  void ShowXY(int x, int y) { IupShowXY(hDlg, x, y); }

protected:

  // implement this to use your own callbacks
  virtual void Show(int mode) {};
  virtual void Resize (int w, int h){}; 
};

int iupDialog::ResizeCB(Ihandle *self, int w, int h)
{
  iupDialog *d = (iupDialog*)IupGetAttribute(self, &quot;iupDialog&quot;);
  d-&gt;test = 1; // private members can be accessed in private static members
  d-&gt;Resize(w, h);
  return IUP_DEFAULT;
}

int ShowCB(Ihandle *self, int mode)
{
  iupDialog *d = (iupDialog*)IupGetAttribute(self, &quot;iupDialog&quot;);
  d-&gt;test = 1; // private members can be accessed in private friend functions
  d-&gt;Show(mode);
  return IUP_DEFAULT;
}</pre>
<p>This is just one possibility on how to write a wrapper class around IUP 
functions. Some users contributed with C++ wrappers, see next on <strong>

<blockquote>
<p>Described by his words:</p>
<p><em>- It works fine with the C++ STL and doesn't define a set of own string, list, vector etc. classes like many 
    other toolkits do (for example wxWidgets).<br>
    - It has a really simple event handling mechanism that is much simpler than the system that is used in MFC or in 
    wxWidgets and that doesn't require a preprocessor like Qt. (It could be done type safe using templates as in a 
    signal and slot library but the current way is really, really simple to understand and to write.)<br>
    - It has a Widget type for creating wizards.<br>
    - It is not complete, some things are missing. It was tested only on the Windows platform.</em></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.cheshireeng.com/free/index.html">IupAsync</a> by Ross

<blockquote>
<p>Described by his words:</p>
	<p><em>IUP is not designed to be accessed from multiple threads, but 
	occasionally there is a need (especially in a multi-threaded application) 
	for the UI to update a display or dispatch an action in response to messages 
	from other threads or from an OS component. To address this need, we 
	designed an IUP control that translates calls from any application thread 
	into a callback function guaranteed to be running in IUP&#39;s thread. </em></p>
<p><em>The IupAsync control is presently an alpha release proving the concept 
for the Windows platform only. It is intended that it be ported to the other 
platforms supported by IUP (GTK and Motif for Linux and OSX).</em></p>
