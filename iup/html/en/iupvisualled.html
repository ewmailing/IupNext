<p>IupVisualLED, or simply VLed, is an integrated development environment to 
edit and test LED files. It is inspired by some popular visual interface 
editors, but it has its own characteristics and features. </p>
<p>Historically the VLed name came from a master dissertation written by Raquel 
Prates back in 1994:</p>
<pre>Oliveira Prates, R.; Gattass, M. ;and Figueiredo, L. H. 
&quot;Visual LED: uma ferramenta interativa para geração de interfaces gráficas&quot;
M.Sc. dissertation, Computer Science Department, PUC-Rio, 1994.
[<a href="../download/prates94.pdf">prates94.pdf</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in Portuguese]</pre>
<p>T<span class="auto-style2">he new VLed has the essence of that work and 
evolve it with the objective of providing a complete environment for editing and 
testing LED files. </span></p>
<p>When a LED file is automatically loaded and its elements are created and 
displayed at the tree bellow. The elements in the tree are listed in the same 
order they are declared in the code. Some elements in the hierarchy tree are 
links to the element itself, a double click will select the actual element. A 
double click in the element will select it in the code. The automatic load can 
be disabled and the load or unload can be done manually in the LED menu. After 
editing the elements can be updated using the Load option.</p>

the main dialog inherits from the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="dlg/iupscintilladlg.html" style="font-family: tahoma, verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">IupScintillaDlg</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tahoma, verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"><span>&nbsp;</span>dialog 
and provides a very powerful multiple file text editor.</span></p>

<h3>Openning a File</h3>
<p>A file can be opened from the File/Open menu item, the Recent submenu, from 
the project file list, it can be dragged and dropped from the system file 
manager in Windows and in Linux, or from the command line. The command line will 
process regular led files and if the extension is vled it will open a project 
file. So the executable can be associated with the led and vled extensions, so 
the user will be able to double click these files in the system file manager.</p>
<h3>Load and Unload</h3>
<p>By default automatic loading is enabled, so when a file is opened its 
elements are created and the tree of elements is filled. But even in this 
configuration after editing the text the changes are not automatically 
processed. To do so, the LED/Load menu item must be called after finished 
editing. </p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>
When a&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tahoma, verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Project</strong>&nbsp;is 
used all parameters are saved in the project file instead of 
the global configuration file.<span>&nbsp;In a project you can add several files 
for easy access.</span></p>

<p>
By default we use the .vled file extension so it can be associated in the file 
manager with the Vled application.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">

<h3>New Controls</h3>
<p>In the context menu of the tree of elements, the layout of a dialog can be 
displayed and its hierarchy edited. But whenever an element is added or removed 
from the layout the LED is re-written to reflect the changes. When this occurs 
all comments (except those at the beginning of the original file) are lost and the file is completely reformatted even for small 
modifications. For now this is what we need to do to keep the LED in sync with 
the new dialog layout. Maybe in the future we will be able to update selected 
regions of the LED.</p>
<p>The layout of a dialog allow also to move controls around or to insert new 
controls. The operation can be done at the tree or at the layout. The menu 
Elements (shown also with a right click) has several interesting options too, 
including several forms to insert new elements. To insert at a 
visually specified location first select the container where you want to move 
or insert the element, then you will notice a green line indicating the insertion 
point. </p>
<p class="auto-style3"><img src="images/vled2.png"></p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>Similar to the Element Properties dialog, the user can display the list of 
global attributes, handle names and functions using the Tools / Globals menu. 
The attributes can be changed in the dialog.</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><img src="images/vled3.png"></p>
<p>Also in the Tools menu the Class Info item displays a dialog that show all 
IUP control classes, with their respective information, attributes and 
callbacks. When an attribute or callback is selected, information about that 
attribute or callback is displayed. </p>
<p class="auto-style3"><img src="images/vled4.png"></p>
<p>Two other available tools are dialogs to show the loaded images and the stock 
images, where the visual appearance of the images can be inspected. </p>
<p class="auto-style3"><img src="images/vled5.png"></p>
<h3>Export</h3>
<p>If you don't want to rewrite your own LED files, or if you want to work with 
Lua or C files, then the working files can be exported to LED, C or Lua, in the 
menu Tools. But only the loaded elements will be exported.</p>
