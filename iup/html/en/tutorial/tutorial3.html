<h2>3. Simple Notepad</h2>
<h3>3.1 <a name="Main_Dialog">Main Dialog</a></h3>

<p>Since now we saw two different controls: labels and buttons. Labels can show 
text or images to the user but
are not designed for interaction. Buttons allow the user to trigger an event by 
pressing a mouse button. But none 
allow the user to insert any data into our application. To do that we will use a new control 
called <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a>. It creates an editable text field and has a lot of different 
attributes available.
We will be interested in one in particular for now: MULTILINE. MULTILINE turns the <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> into an 
editable text field that supports many lines which is mandatory to build a simple notepad.</p>

<p>Our starting code for the simple notepad should be as following...</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_1.c">example3_1.c</a></p>

<pre class="example">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;iup.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Ihandle *dlg, *multitext, *vbox;

  <strong>IupOpen</strong>(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  multitext = <strong>IupText</strong>(NULL);
  vbox = IupVbox(
    multitext,
    NULL);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(multitext, "MULTILINE", "YES");
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(multitext, "EXPAND", "YES");

  dlg = <strong>IupDialog</strong>(vbox);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "TITLE", "Simple Notepad");
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "SIZE", "QUARTERxQUARTER");

  <strong>IupShowXY</strong>(dlg, IUP_CENTER, IUP_CENTER);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "USERSIZE", NULL);

  <strong>IupMainLoop</strong>();

  <strong>IupClose</strong>();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_1.png"></p>

<p>The previous code doesn't show exciting news except by the <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> declaration and the call to <A href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetAttribute</strong></a>
to set the <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> as a MULTILINE. The default value is "NO", try to comment this line and see what happens. 
</p>
<p>Notice that the <a href="../attrib/iup_size.html">SIZE</a> attribute of the dialog was also set. Because the <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> 
is a control that does not fit its size to its contents we have to set an 
initial size for the dialog, or else the result would be a very small dialog. 
We use a simple size specification that is a quarter of the screen size in both 
dimensions. The SIZE attribute will also work as a minimum size, so we reset the USERSIZE 
attribute after the dialog is show to avoid this limitation. Experiment to 
comment this line and check how the dialog interactive resize behaves.</p>
<p>With a few lines of code we build an application where the user can type a huge text. But, if you type a huge 
text, you probably would like to save it and unfortunately our applications offers no such feature. We will
handle this in the next sections.</p>

<h3>3.2 <a name="Adding_a_Menu">Adding a Menu</a></h3>

<p>Almost all applications offer a menu where the user can load files, save 
files, use the clipboard and do a lot of other stuff with his data.
IUP also offers this resource to the applications. Menus are divided into four different interface elements: <A href="../elem/iupitem.html"><strong>IupItem</strong></a>, 
<A href="../elem/iupmenu.html"><strong>IupMenu</strong></a>, <A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a>, <A href="../elem/iupsubmenu.html"><strong>IupSubmenu</strong></a>.</p>

<p><A href="../elem/iupitem.html"><strong>IupItem</strong></a> creates an single item of the menu interface element. When selected, it generates an action.</p>

<p><A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a> creates an 
horizontal line that will appear between two menu items. Its used normally to divide and arrange different 
groups
of menu items.</p>

<p><A href="../elem/iupsubmenu.html"><strong>IupSubmenu</strong></a> creates an item that, when selected, opens another menu.</p>

<p><A href="../elem/iupmenu.html"><strong>IupMenu</strong></a> creates the menu element by itself 
as a list of elements. An <A href="../elem/iupmenu.html"><strong>IupMenu</strong></a> 
can include any number of the other 3 types of menu interface elements: <A href="../elem/iupitem.html"><strong>IupItem</strong></a>, <A href="../elem/iupsubmenu.html"><strong>IupSubmenu</strong></a> and <A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a>. Any other 
type of interface element inserted in a 
menu will be an error.</p>

<p>Let's add a menu with a few items in our example<span lang="pt-br">:</span></p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_2.c">example3_2.c</a></p>

<pre class="example">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;iup.h&gt;

int exit_cb(void)
{
  return IUP_CLOSE;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Ihandle *dlg, *multitext, *vbox;
  Ihandle *file_menu, *item_exit, *item_open, *item_save;
  Ihandle *sub1_menu, *menu;

  <strong>IupOpen</strong>(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  multitext = <strong>IupText</strong>(NULL);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(multitext, "MULTILINE", "YES");
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(multitext, "EXPAND", "YES");

  item_open = <strong>IupItem</strong> ("Open", NULL);
  item_save = <strong>IupItem</strong> ("Save", NULL);
  item_exit = <strong>IupItem</strong> ("Exit", NULL);
  <strong>IupSetCallback</strong>(item_exit, "ACTION", (Icallback)exit_cb);

  file_menu = <strong>IupMenu</strong>(item_open,
    item_save,
    <strong>IupSeparator</strong>(),
    item_exit,
    NULL);

  sub1_menu = <strong>IupSubmenu</strong>("File", file_menu);

  menu = <strong>IupMenu</strong>(sub1_menu, NULL);

  vbox = <strong>IupVbox</strong>(
    multitext,
    NULL);

  dlg = <strong>IupDialog</strong>(vbox);
  <strong>IupSetAttributeHandle</strong>(dlg, "MENU", menu);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "TITLE", "Simple Notepad");
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "SIZE", "QUARTERxQUARTER");

  <strong>IupShowXY</strong>(dlg, IUP_CENTER, IUP_CENTER);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "USERSIZE", NULL);

  <strong>IupMainLoop</strong>();

  <strong>IupClose</strong>();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_2.png"></p>

<p>Now our example has a few menu element handlers and declarations. Also, we 
also used our exit callback to be called
when the item_exit menu item is selected. The next line shows the composition of an <A href="../elem/iupmenu.html"><strong>IupMenu</strong></a> called file_menu. Note that
the menu items are passed in order of appearance meaning item_open will appear above item_save and so on. There is also
an <A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a> dividing our file menu in two parts, the first one takes items that deal direct with files like open and
save and the other one takes the exit item. It's not mandatory to have an <A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a> in your menu. It's is used just to
keep things more organized. Next line is a little trick. We created a submenu to store all our items. Why not use file_menu
directly? We could, but it would be used as main menu and will ending up being the only menu available in our application.
It's a good practice to separate menus in submenus and then pass this submenus as 
items of the main menu. Doing so, an 
application could have a file menu, a search menu, a help menu and others as items of the main menu as you can see in the 
main menu declaration on the next line.<p>At last, once we have done building the main menu, we must set the MENU 
attribute of the main dialog as the menu we just created. But since it is not a 
string nor a number, we must use a different function to do this association, 
that is called <a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html"><strong>
IupSetAttributeHandle</strong></a>.<p>You should have notice that the exit menu 
item works fine as we set the <em>Exit</em> menu item action callback, but <em>Open</em> and 
<em>Save</em> still doesn't work.
That's because we didn't set any callback for them. Those callbacks will use another IUP feature that is subject of
our next section.<h3>3.3 <a name="Using_Pre-defined_Dialogs">Using Pre-defined Dialogs</a></h3>

<p>In the previous section we added a file open and a file save menu items, but they had no callbacks associated. 
That's because we will use new IUP resources to deal with file handling. These 
resources are called Pre-defined Dialogs.<p>Some dialogs are commonly found in a lot of different applications like file 
selection dialogs, font selection dialogs,
color selection dialogs, etc. 
It would be annoying to have to build the same dialog again every time we need 
to select a file, or to select a color or a font.
So, IUP provides pre-defined dialogs with all necessary controls to deal with these common tasks.<p>
We will update our last example to handle file input/output, and to make use of these IUP pre-defined dialogs<span lang="pt-br">:</span>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_3.c">example3_3.c</a></p>

<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example3_3.c" name="example3_3" title="Example 8" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>

<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_3.png"></p>

<p> We will need to access the multitext control from inside the menu callbacks. 
There are many ways to do that, the simplest is to declare it as a global 
variable. We will do that to illustrate in this example, but this is not 
recommended. In the next example we will show you how to not use a global 
variable to obtain the same results.</p>
<p> Now we have interesting new functions. First, let&#39;s take a look at the new callback called open_cb. This callback
will handle the file opening when the user clicks the Open menu item. For this we will used a IUP predefined dialog called
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupFileDlg</strong></a>. This dialog is a standard file handling dialog with all 
features that we need to select a file from the file system, and it will save a 
lot of work. Inside the callback we create our 
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupFileDlg</strong></a>, and set it to be an 
&quot;open&quot; dialog with attribute DIALOGTYPE. Also we set FILTER attribute to *.txt and FILTERINFO to "Text Files" because we want our application to 
handle just text files.</p>

<p> Now the program calls <A href="../dlg/iuppopup.html"><strong>IupPopup</strong></a> which is a function similar to 
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupShow</strong></a>, but restricts the user 
interaction only to the specified dialog. It is equivalent of creating a Modal  dialog is some toolkits. Its arguments are our 
file dialog Ihandle followed by x and y coordinates that we defined as the center of the screen with IUP_CENTER.<p>Then we have a conditional test where we get the value of filedlg STATUS with <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetInt</strong></a>. 
Why not use <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetAttribute</strong></a> 
instead? That's because <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetAttribute</strong></a> returns 
attributes as strings, but we know that STATUS is an integer so we can simplify 
our status check using <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetInt</strong></a>.<p>Once our file dialog return a valid status, we are able to recover the name of the selected file using <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetAttribute</strong></a> 
to retrieve the VALUE attribute. Then we read the file using a simple function 
and fill its contents to the multitext control using the 
<a href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetStrAttribute</strong></a> 
function to set its VALUE attribute. We can not use the
<a href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetAttribute</strong></a> 
function because our C string returned by <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetAttribute</strong></a> 
is a dynamically allocated pointer, <a href="../func/iupsetattribute.html">
<strong>IupSetStrAttribute</strong></a> will make sure the string is duplicated 
internally and not dependent on the given pointer.<p>Now 
we are done at this dialog. 
Simply call <A href="../func/iupdestroy.html"><strong>IupDestroy</strong></a>
to remove filedlg from memory because we will not need it anymore.<p>Next there is another callback that 
will select a file name for saving the content of a file. It is not much 
different from open by setting DIALOGTYPE to SAVE, so this time it will select a 
file name that can be a new file, and we are going to save the multitext 
contents to the file.<p>Now comes the font_cb callback that, as you may already guessed, will call a predefined dialog to 
select a font. To do that we use <A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupFontDlg</strong></a> 
instead of 
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupFileDlg</strong></a>. To set the 
font just change the FONT attribute of the multitext control.</p>

<p>Next callback is about_cb that does nothing special, just call 
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupMessage</strong></a> to 
display a text to the user.<p> Following lines doesn't show anything new, except 
for the new callbacks registration. But notice that we added &quot;...&quot; to the text 
of the menu items where a dialog is open. This is not obligatory, but it is 
highly recommended by common
<a href="https://www.google.com.br/?gws_rd=ssl#q=User+Interface+Guidelines">User 
Interface Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p> Finally we now have a brand new text editor using IUP. But what happens if the dialog that 
your application needs is not provided by IUP as a predefined dialog? That will be the subject of our next section.</p>

<h3>3.4 <a name="Custom_Dialogs">Custom Dialogs</a></h3>

<p>We saw in the previous section that IUP provides predefined dialogs that are 
common to most applications and using this dialogs will save a lot of developing 
time. But if the dialog your application needs is not one of IUP's predefined 
dialogs, it's time to build your own dialog. The good news is that you already 
made this when building your main dialog. The tricky part here is just how to 
handle more then one dialog at the same time. </p>
<p>For this we will add two items to our menu: Find and Go To. Find will search 
the multitext contents looking for a string and highlight it when found. It will 
search for this string many times and also will be case sensitive. Go To will 
send the cursor to a specific line in the text.</p>
<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_4.c">example3_4.c</a></p>

<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example3_4.c" name="example3_4" title="Example 9" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_4.png"></p>

<p>First change is the inclusion of two C functions (str_compare and str_find) 
that will be used to implement Find and are not object of this tutorial. If you 
want to understand what is inside this functions take a closer look into the 
code.</p>
<p>Allow me to make a jump in our code and please refer now to 
item_find_action_cb. This callback, despite been almost at the end of the code, 
is responsible do build our custom dialog. In this dialog we will use some 
elements that we already saw in previous sessions: a text field to receive the 
string that the user wants to find, a button to find the next occurence of this 
string, a button to close our find custom dialog, and two new IUP elements:
<a href="../elem/iuptoggle.html"><strong>IupToggle</strong></a> and
<a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>IupFill</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="../elem/iuptoggle.html"><strong>IupToggle</strong></a> is a 
two-state (on/off) button that, when selected, execute a callback. Toggles are 
normally used to set flags. In this case, we used it to allow the user to decide 
if he wants the search to be case sensitive or not.</p>
<p><a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>IupFill</strong></a> is a very 
peculiar element. It is, as the name says, used to fill blank spaces inside our 
dialog. Or, in other words, to position and align IUP elements. Best way to 
understand IupFill is to think in it as a coil. If you put a
<a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>IupFill</strong></a>, inside a
<a href="../elem/iuphbox.html"><strong>IupHbox</strong></a>, between to elements 
it will expand pushing one to the left and the other to the right. Or if you put 
it, in a <a href="../elem/iupvbox.html"><strong>IupVbox</strong></a>, above a 
element, it will push the element all the way down. IupFill also has a SIZE 
attribute. This will fix how much space will be taken. With experience we will 
find the correct way to define SIZES for <a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>
IupFill</strong></a> and for other elements as well. In our case,
<a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>IupFill</strong></a> is been used to push 
button next and button close to the right size of our hbox. We also have some 
callback associations as we have new elements and new callbacks.</p>
<p>Note that our new custom dialog has a lot of new parameters set. DIALOGFRAME 
will remove minbox, maxbox and resize from the corner of the dialog. 
DEFAULTENTER is defining press ENTER will do the same effect of pressing the 
button next_bt. DEFAULTESC works the same way for button close_bt and ESC key. 
Next the attribute PARENTALDIALOG is setting the dialog that holds item_find 
(our main dialog) as the parent of our new dialog using
<a href="../func/iupgetdialog.html"><strong>IupGetDialog</strong></a> which 
returns the handle of the dialog that contains the element passed as parameter. 
This will allow us to set the find dialog position at the center of the parent 
dialog. Imagine if the user dragged our application a little to the right 
because he wants to see another application while using ours. If we popup the 
file dialog using IUP_CENTER the dialog will appear, at the center of the 
screen, blocking the users view. This would be annoying. Using IUP_PARENTCENTER 
or IUP_CURRENT garantees that the dialog will popup at the center of its parent 
dialog and not blocking user's view.</p>
<p>In the next two lines we are using a resource that IUP offers called create 
new attributes. Each IUP element can hold as many attributes as you want. If 
your element demands an attribute that is not on the manual, you can just set it 
as we are doing here. We created a new attribute called MULTITEXT in our custom 
dialog to store the multitext content and make it available to other callbacks. 
Also, we created another new attribute called FIND_DIALOG in element find_item 
so we can be able to reuse this dialog.</p>
<p>Next we show our dialog using <a href="../func/iupshow.html"><strong>IupShow</strong></a> 
and passing IUP_CURRENT to it. This will center the dialog acording to its 
parent (main dialog as we defined above) in the first time and reuse the last 
position in the next time.</p>
<p>Now that we have built our find dialog, its time to build the callbacks that 
will effectivelly do the job of find our string inside our multitext. First 
thing you may notice in it should be a few calls </p>
<p>Let's turn our attention to callback ind_next_action_cb now. This callback 
is responsible to find the next occurence of our string inside the multiline and 
has a lot new function calls. We made a call to
<a href="../func/iupgetdialogchild.html"><strong>IupGetDialogChild</strong></a>. 
This function returns the identifier of the child element that has the NAME 
attribute equals to the given value on the same dialog hierarchy. It's used to 
retreive the multitext handle. Despite more complicated, retriving handles this 
way, avoid to make then global variables. As next new thing is a call to
<a href="../func/iupsetfocus.html"><strong>IupSetFocus</strong></a>. When we 
poped up our find dialog we removed the focus from our multiline turning it to 
the new dialog. This function is restoring the focus to the multiline when a 
string is found. Next we find two calls to
<a href="../func/iuptextconvertpostolincol.html"><strong>
IupTextConvertPosToLinCol</strong></a> and
<a href="../func/iuptextconvertlincoltopos.html"><strong>
IupTextConvertLinColToPos</strong></a>. They are here just to our knowledge as 
we need only the position value stored in pos variable. First one receives a 
position in a <a href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> and 
returns it in terms of line and collumn. Second one does the oposite.</p>
<p>Beside next_bt, find dialog also has close_bt and it also demands a callback. 
Find_close_action_cb closes the find custom dialog. In this callback we made a 
call to <a href="../func/iuphide.html"><strong>IupHide</strong></a>. Once a 
dialog is hidden, remain in memory, so that you can show them again. To destroy 
dialogs, the <a href="../func/iupdestroy.html"><strong>IupDestroy</strong></a> 
function must be called.</p>
<p>As you may have notice we changed the way to name callbacks. Use names that 
detail what the callback does and what item calls the callback is a good pratice. 
We will start do do this now because our code is starting to get huge and work 
with simple names may lead to confusion. So, open_cb now is called 
item_open_action_cb and it receives a parameter that is the item_open ihandle. 
The other previous callbacks will follow the same line of item_open_action_cb.</p>
<p>Also there are some new callbacks like goto_ok_action_cb, 
goto_cancel_action_cb, item_goto_action_cb, item_find_action_cb, that will 
handle events for Find and Go To. There are no new function calls in this 
callbacks except by the calls to <a href="../func/iupgetdialog.html"><strong>
IupGetDialog</strong></a></p>
<p>which returns the handle of the dialog that contains the element passed as 
parameter.</p>
<p>Go To custom dialog will work in the same way. If you understood how to 
create find custom dialog you should be able to build Go To dialogs with no 
difficult.</p>

<h3>3.5 <a name="Clipboard">Clipboard</a> Support</h3>

<p>Following we will find two callbacks that will handle copy and paste from Edit menu. Both are very short callbacks and use a resource 
called <A href="../elem/iupclipboard.html"><strong>IupClipboard</strong></a> which creates an element that allows access to the clipboard. 
Each clipboard should be destroyed using IupDestroy. You can use only one for the entire application because it does not store any data inside. 
Or you can simply create and destroy every time you need to copy or paste. In this example we have choosed to create and destroy. copy_cb
sets the attribute TEXT from clipboard to store the content of attribute SELECTEDTEXT from our multitext. Paste does the oposite. Retrives
the clipboard TEXT attribute and stores it in multitext VALUE

<h3>3.6 <a name="Toolbar_Statusbar">Adding a Toolbar and a Statusbar</a></h3>
<p>Now that we already saw how to use predefined dialogs or how to build our own 
dialogs, lets see how to implement two other resources present in many other 
applications: toolbars and status bars.</p>
<p>Toolbars are a set of buttons, usually positioned, side by side, in dialogs 
top, just bellow the menu. To build our toolbar we will use the attribute IMAGE 
of <a href="../elem/iupbutton.html"><strong>IupButton</strong></a>. As in 
predefined dialogs, IUP also offers a serie of predefined images to be used with 
buttons. This images are part of a additional library called
<a href="../iupimagelib.html"><strong>IupImageLib</strong></a>. To use this 
library you should call <strong>IupImageLibOpen</strong> just after
<a href="../func/iupopen.html"><strong>IupOpen</strong>.</p>
</a>
<p>Statusbars normally appear in bottom of main dialog and show some information 
about what is happening inside the application. To build our statusbar we will 
use a set of <a href="../elem/iuplabel.html"><strong>IupLabel</strong></a> 
controls arranged side by side. In our statusbar we will be displaying the 
cursor's current position in the text and to achive this we will use a IupText 
callback called CARET_CB that is called every time the cursor changes it's 
position. The code will be like this:</p>
<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_5.c">example3_5.c</a></p>

<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example3_5.c" name="example3_5" title="Example 10" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>

<br>
<p>First change, as told above, is the inclusion of multitext_caret_cb to our 
callbacks. In this callback we will make use of the parameter received by the 
callback. First we retrieve the handle of <a href="../elem/iuplabel.html">
<strong>IupLabel</strong></a> called lbl_curpos using
<a href="../func/iupgetdialogchild.html"><strong>IupGetDialogChild</strong></a> 
passing the handle ih which came as a parameter of our callback. Next, we build 
a string using lin and col parameters where the callback returns the cursor line 
and collumn. Finally we set the label's TITLE as the string we just build. All 
set. The callback is called every time the cursor moves inside the multitext and 
display in the label its line and collumn.</p>
<p>From this new callback we will jump to main function where the next change 
appears. Just after IupOpen you will find a call to
<a href="../iupimagelib.html"><strong>IupImageLib</strong></a>. This function 
will load the image library that will be used in our toolbar.</p>
<p>A few lines after we will find our lbl_curpos declaration. This label will 
play the role of our status bar. Following we will see some button declarations 
(btn_open, btn_save and btn_find) and some calls to
<a href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetAttribute</strong></a> 
setting each buttons image. The images names can be found at
<a href="../iupimagelib.html"><strong>IupImageLib</strong></a>. Then we notice 
that our toolbar is nothing more then a <a href="../elem/iuphbox.html"><strong>
IupHbox</strong></a> containing those buttons. Note, a few lines after, that we 
set for the buttons the same callbacks set for the items. This is desireble 
because the buttons do exactly the samething as the itens just representing a 
short way to call open, save or find.</p>
<p>Final change will be the inclusion of toolbar_hb and lbl_curpos in the vbox 
that already had our multiline. Toolbar cames first because its a vbox and we 
want it above the multiline. lbl_curpos goes after because we want it bellow the 
multiline. That's all. Our application now has both a toolbar and a status bar. 
In the next section we will improve it even more adding hot keys to our menus.</p>
<h3>3.7 Defining <a name="Hot_Keys">Hot Keys</a></h3>
<p>Applications that has menus always present hotkeys to its users. IUP also 
offers this resource. To define a hotkey you should use
<a href="../elem/iupdialog.html"><strong>IupDialog</strong></a>'s callback
<a href="../call/iup_k_any.html"><strong>K_ANY</strong></a>. This is a callback 
common to a lot of iup elements and is called when a keyboard event occur. IUP 
also offers a sugar sintaxe that allow you to call a specific callback for the 
key combination you want to deal with. For example: you want to open a file if 
user press Ctrl+O you just set a callback called K_cO.
<a href="../attrib/key.html"><strong>Keyboard Codes</strong></a> shows a 
complete table with all keyboard codes available in IUP.</p>
<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_6.c">example3_6.c</a></p>

<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example3_6.c" name="example3_6" title="Example 11" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>

<p>This example has not changed much. We just add "\tCtr+?" to each menu item 
that has a hotkey. Character "\t" will take care of shift our hotkey to the 
right and the rest of the string just tells the user which key combinations to 
press. Note that "?" should replaced by the key you want.</p>
<p>A few lines after we did a few calls to IupSetCallback passing callback names 
using IUP sugar sintaxe mentioned above to deal with key pressed events. And we 
are done. Thatś all we need to change to include hotkeys in our application.</p>
<p>During this chapter we went from a 25 lines of code application that did 
almost nothing to a usefull notepad with file read and write, text search, line 
counting and other resources. In the next chapter we will see how to draw in the 
screen and build a paint like application. </p>

<h3>3.8 <a name="Recent_Config">Recent Files Menu and Configuration File</a> </h3>
<p>Many text editors offer a menu item that holds a list of recent files. We are 
going to use a IUP resource called <a href="../func/iupconfig.html"><strong>
IupConfig</strong></a> to implement this list and also store other configuration 
variables. IupConfig implements a group of functions to load, store and save 
application configuration variables. For example, the list of Recent Files, the 
last position and size of a dialog, last used parameters in dialogs, etc. Each 
variable has a key name, a value and a group that it belongs to.</p>
<p>Its important to remember that using <a href="../func/iupconfig.html">
<strong>IupConfig</strong></a> demands the inclusion of header file iup_config.h.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example12.c">example12.c</a></p>

<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example12.c" name="example12" title="Example 12" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>

<p>Note that in this new example we have included the iup_config.h header as 
advised above. We are going to start this analysis from our main function. After 
creating a handle for our config called config_db, we called
<a href="../func/iupconfig.html"><strong>IupConfig</strong></a> and had set the 
attribute APP_NAME. This attribute defines the name of our configuration file. 
In UNIX, the filename will be "<HOME>/.
<APP_NAME>", where "<HOME>" is replaced by the "HOME" environment variable 
contents, and <APP_NAME> replaced by the APP_NAME attribute value. In Windows, 
the filename will be "<HOMEDRIVE><HOMEPATH>\<APP_NAME>.cfg", where HOMEDRIVE and 
HOMEPATH are also obtained from environment variables. We also had set a new 
attribute called NAME to make possible to recover the config_db handle in 
callbacks exactly as we made with our multitext before. </p>
<p>Following, a few lines bellow, we have created recent_menu that will hold our 
recent_item inside our file_menu. You will see that it works as any other menu 
creation except by the fact we will not create the recent_item. It will be 
provided by a function that we will see soon. We positioned our recent_menu just 
bellow open and save itens and above the <a href="../elem/iupseparator.html">
<strong>IupSeparator</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Then comes a call to IupConfigLoad that will load our config file when the 
application starts followed by a call to IupConfigRecentInit. This function is 
resposible to create the recent_item and insert it at the menu passed as a 
parameter. As we passed our recent_menu, recent_item will be displayed at its 
position. The other parameters this function receives, despite the config_db by 
itself, are a callback item_recent_cb that will be called when the user selects 
a file in the recent list and the number of files what will be stored in the 
list. In our example we choosed to store 10 files.</p>
<p>Next line shows a call to IupConfigDialogShow that replaces IupShow when 
using a IupConfig. This functions store and manage the position and size of a 
dialog. So when the application is run again the dialog can be show at its last 
position and size. Use the function IupConfigDialogShow to show the dialog 
adjusting its size and position.</p>
<p>Function IupConfigDialogClosed is used to save the last dialog position and 
size when the dialog is about to be closed, usually inside the dialog CLOSE_CB 
callback. Please refer to item_exit_action_cb to find this inclusion on our 
code.</p>
<p>Just before we close our application its necessary to call IupConfigSave to 
save our configuration file. And now that it is saved we can destroy it.</p>
<p>That's all for the main function which turns our attention to the callbacks. 
Let's start with our brand new item_recent_cb. This callback, as said before, is 
responsible to handle the event of click in a recent file of our list. Inside 
it, we recover our multitext and use it to recover our IupConfig config_db. Once 
we recovered it, we get the file name stored in the TITLE attribute of 
item_recent and open it the same way we do in item_open_cb.</p>
<p>Also note that both item_open_cb and item_save_cb should change the recent 
files list. So a call to IupConfigRecentUpdate is necessary to mantain our 
recent files list updated.</p>
<p>That's all for chapter three. If you reached this lines you should be able to 
build a notepad like application using a lot of IUP's resources. In our next 
chapter we will introduce another Tecgraf library used to draw primitives over a 
canvas element.</p>
