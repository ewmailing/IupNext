<h2>3. Simple Notepad</h2>
<h3>3.1 <a name="Main_Dialog">Main Dialog</a></h3>

<p>Since now we saw two different controls: labels and buttons. Labels can show 
text or images to the user but
are not designed for interaction. Buttons allow the user to trigger an event by 
pressing a mouse button. But none 
allow the user to insert any data into our application. To do that we will use a new control 
called <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a>. It creates an editable text field and has a lot of different 
attributes available.
We will be interested in one in particular for now: MULTILINE. MULTILINE turns the <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> into an 
editable text field that supports many lines which is mandatory to build a simple notepad.</p>

<p>Our starting code for the simple notepad should be as following.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_1.c">example3_1.c</a></p>

<pre class="example">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;iup.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Ihandle *dlg, *multitext, *vbox;

  <strong>IupOpen</strong>(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  multitext = <strong>IupText</strong>(NULL);
  vbox = IupVbox(
    multitext,
    NULL);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(multitext, "MULTILINE", "YES");
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(multitext, "EXPAND", "YES");

  dlg = <strong>IupDialog</strong>(vbox);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "TITLE", "Simple Notepad");
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "SIZE", "QUARTERxQUARTER");

  <strong>IupShowXY</strong>(dlg, IUP_CENTER, IUP_CENTER);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "USERSIZE", NULL);

  <strong>IupMainLoop</strong>();

  <strong>IupClose</strong>();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_1.png"></p>

<p>The previous code doesn't show exciting news except by the <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> declaration and the call to <A href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetAttribute</strong></a>
to set the <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> as a MULTILINE. The default value is "NO", try to comment this line and see what happens. 
</p>
<p>Notice that the <a href="../attrib/iup_size.html">SIZE</a> attribute of the dialog was also set. Because the <A href="../elem/iuptext.html"><strong>IupText</strong></a> 
is a control that does not fit its size to its contents we have to set an 
initial size for the dialog, or else the result would be a very small dialog. 
We use a simple size specification that is a quarter of the screen size in both 
dimensions. The SIZE attribute will also work as a minimum size, so we reset the USERSIZE 
attribute after the dialog is show to avoid this limitation. Experiment to 
comment this line and check how the dialog interactive resize behaves.</p>
<p>With a few lines of code we build an application where the user can type a huge text. But, if you type a huge 
text, you probably would like to save it and unfortunately our applications offers no such feature. We will
handle this in the next sections.</p>

<h3>3.2 <a name="Adding_a_Menu">Adding a Menu</a></h3>

<p>Almost all applications offer a menu where the user can load files, save 
files, use the clipboard and do a lot of other stuff with his data.
IUP also offers this resource to the applications. Menus are divided into four different interface elements: <A href="../elem/iupitem.html"><strong>IupItem</strong></a>, 
<A href="../elem/iupmenu.html"><strong>IupMenu</strong></a>, <A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a>, <A href="../elem/iupsubmenu.html"><strong>IupSubmenu</strong></a>.</p>

<p><A href="../elem/iupitem.html"><strong>IupItem</strong></a> creates an single item of the menu interface element. When selected, it generates an action.</p>

<p><A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a> creates an 
horizontal line that will appear between two menu items. Its used normally to divide and arrange different 
groups
of menu items.</p>

<p><A href="../elem/iupsubmenu.html"><strong>IupSubmenu</strong></a> creates an item that, when selected, opens another menu.</p>

<p><A href="../elem/iupmenu.html"><strong>IupMenu</strong></a> creates the menu element by itself 
as a list of elements. An <A href="../elem/iupmenu.html"><strong>IupMenu</strong></a> 
can include any number of the other 3 types of menu interface elements: <A href="../elem/iupitem.html"><strong>IupItem</strong></a>, <A href="../elem/iupsubmenu.html"><strong>IupSubmenu</strong></a> and <A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a>. Any other 
type of interface element inserted in a 
menu will be an error.</p>

<p>Let's add a menu with a few items in our example.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_2.c">example3_2.c</a></p>

<pre class="example">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;iup.h&gt;

int exit_cb(void)
{
  return IUP_CLOSE;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Ihandle *dlg, *multitext, *vbox;
  Ihandle *file_menu, *item_exit, *item_open, *item_save;
  Ihandle *sub1_menu, *menu;

  <strong>IupOpen</strong>(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  multitext = <strong>IupText</strong>(NULL);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(multitext, "MULTILINE", "YES");
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(multitext, "EXPAND", "YES");

  item_open = <strong>IupItem</strong> ("Open", NULL);
  item_save = <strong>IupItem</strong> ("Save", NULL);
  item_exit = <strong>IupItem</strong> ("Exit", NULL);
  <strong>IupSetCallback</strong>(item_exit, "ACTION", (Icallback)exit_cb);

  file_menu = <strong>IupMenu</strong>(item_open,
    item_save,
    <strong>IupSeparator</strong>(),
    item_exit,
    NULL);

  sub1_menu = <strong>IupSubmenu</strong>("File", file_menu);

  menu = <strong>IupMenu</strong>(sub1_menu, NULL);

  vbox = <strong>IupVbox</strong>(
    multitext,
    NULL);

  dlg = <strong>IupDialog</strong>(vbox);
  <strong>IupSetAttributeHandle</strong>(dlg, "MENU", menu);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "TITLE", "Simple Notepad");
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "SIZE", "QUARTERxQUARTER");

  <strong>IupShowXY</strong>(dlg, IUP_CENTER, IUP_CENTER);
  <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong>(dlg, "USERSIZE", NULL);

  <strong>IupMainLoop</strong>();

  <strong>IupClose</strong>();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_2.png"></p>

<p>Now our example has a few menu element handlers and declarations. Also, we 
also used our exit callback to be called
when the item_exit menu item is selected. The next line shows the composition of an <A href="../elem/iupmenu.html"><strong>IupMenu</strong></a> called file_menu. Note that
the menu items are passed in order of appearance meaning item_open will appear above item_save and so on. There is also
an <A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a> dividing our file menu in two parts, the first one takes items that deal direct with files like open and
save and the other one takes the exit item. It's not mandatory to have an <A href="../elem/iupseparator.html"><strong>IupSeparator</strong></a> in your menu. It's is used just to
keep things more organized. Next line is a little trick. We created a submenu to store all our items. Why not use file_menu
directly? We could, but it would be used as main menu and will ending up being the only menu available in our application.
It's a good practice to separate menus in submenus and then pass this submenus as 
items of the main menu. Doing so, an 
application could have a file menu, a search menu, a help menu and others as items of the main menu as you can see in the 
main menu declaration on the next line.<p>At last, once we have done building the main menu, we must set the MENU 
attribute of the main dialog as the menu we just created. But since it is not a 
string nor a number, we must use a different function to do this association, 
that is called <a href="../func/iupsetattributehandle.html"><strong>
IupSetAttributeHandle</strong></a>.<p>You should have notice that the exit menu 
item works fine as we set the <em>Exit</em> menu item action callback, but <em>Open</em> and 
<em>Save</em> still doesn't work.
That's because we didn't set any callback for them. Those callbacks will use another IUP feature that is subject of
our next section.<h3>3.3 <a name="Using_Pre-defined_Dialogs">Using Pre-defined Dialogs</a></h3>

<p>In the previous section we added a file open and a file save menu items, but they had no callbacks associated. 
That's because we will use new IUP resources to deal with file handling. These 
resources are called Pre-defined Dialogs.<p>Some dialogs are commonly found in a lot of different applications like file 
selection dialogs, font selection dialogs,
color selection dialogs, etc. 
It would be annoying to have to build the same dialog again every time we need 
to select a file, or to select a color or a font.
So, IUP provides pre-defined dialogs with all necessary controls to deal with these common tasks.<p>
We will update our last example to handle file input/output, and to make use of these IUP pre-defined dialogs.

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_3.c">example3_3.c</a></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example3_3.c" name="example3_3" title="Example 3.3" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_3.png"></p>

<p> We will need to access the multitext control from inside the menu callbacks. 
There are many ways to do that, the simplest is to declare it as a global 
variable. We will do that to illustrate in this example, but this is not 
recommended. In the next example we will show you how to not use a global 
variable to obtain the same results.</p>
<p> Now we have interesting new functions. First, let&#39;s take a look at the new callback called open_cb. This callback
will handle the file opening when the user clicks the Open menu item. For this we will used a IUP predefined dialog called
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupFileDlg</strong></a>. This dialog is a standard file handling dialog with all 
features that we need to select a file from the file system, and it will save a 
lot of work. Inside the callback we create our 
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupFileDlg</strong></a>, and set it to be an 
&quot;open&quot; dialog with attribute DIALOGTYPE. Also we set FILTER attribute to *.txt and FILTERINFO to "Text Files" because we want our application to 
handle just text files.</p>

<p> Now the program calls <A href="../dlg/iuppopup.html"><strong>IupPopup</strong></a> which is a function similar to 
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupShow</strong></a>, but restricts the user 
interaction only to the specified dialog. It is equivalent of creating a Modal  dialog is some toolkits. Its arguments are our 
file dialog Ihandle followed by x and y coordinates that we defined as the center of the screen with IUP_CENTER.<p>Then we have a conditional test where we get the value of filedlg STATUS with <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetInt</strong></a>. 
Why not use <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetAttribute</strong></a> 
instead? That's because <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetAttribute</strong></a> returns 
attributes as strings, but we know that STATUS is an integer so we can simplify 
our status check using <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetInt</strong></a>.<p>Once our file dialog return a valid status, we are able to recover the name of the selected file using <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetAttribute</strong></a> 
to retrieve the VALUE attribute. Then we read the file using a simple function 
and fill its contents to the multitext control using the 
<a href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetStrAttribute</strong></a> 
function to set its VALUE attribute. We can not use the
<a href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetAttribute</strong></a> 
function because our C string returned by <A href="../func/iupgetattribute.html"><strong>IupGetAttribute</strong></a> 
is a dynamically allocated pointer, <a href="../func/iupsetattribute.html">
<strong>IupSetStrAttribute</strong></a> will make sure the string is duplicated 
internally and not dependent on the given pointer.<p>Now 
we are done at this dialog. 
Simply call <A href="../func/iupdestroy.html"><strong>IupDestroy</strong></a>
to remove filedlg from memory because we will not need it anymore.<p>Next there is another callback, 
saveas_cb, that 
will select a file name for saving the content of a file. It is not much 
different from open by setting DIALOGTYPE to SAVE, so this time it will select a 
file name that can be a new file, and we are going to save the multitext 
contents to the file.<p>Now comes the font_cb callback that, as you may already guessed, will call a predefined dialog to 
select a font. To do that we use <A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupFontDlg</strong></a> 
instead of 
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupFileDlg</strong></a>. To set the 
font just change the FONT attribute of the multitext control.</p>

<p>Next callback is about_cb that does nothing special, just call 
<A href="../dlg/iupfiledlg.html"><strong>IupMessage</strong></a> to 
display a text to the user.<p> Following lines doesn't show anything new, except 
for the new callbacks registration. But notice that we added &quot;...&quot; to the text 
of the menu items where a dialog is open. This is not obligatory, but it is 
highly recommended by common
<a href="https://www.google.com.br/?gws_rd=ssl#q=User+Interface+Guidelines">User 
Interface Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p> Finally we now have a brand new text editor using IUP. But what happens if the dialog that 
your application needs is not provided by IUP as a predefined dialog? That will be the subject of our next section.</p>

<h3>3.4 <a name="Custom_Dialogs">Custom Dialogs</a></h3>

<p>We saw in the previous section that IUP provides predefined dialogs that can 
be used by the applications to save a lot of developing 
time. But if the dialog your application needs is not one of IUP's predefined 
dialogs, then it's time to build your own dialog. The good news is that you already 
made this when building your main dialog. The tricky part here is just how to 
handle more then one dialog at the same time. </p>
<p>For this we will add two new items to our Edit menu: Find and Go To. Find will search 
the multitext contents looking for a string and highlight it when found. It will 
search for this string many times and the search can also be case sensitive. Go To will 
position the caret to a specific line in the text.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_4.c">example3_4.c</a></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example3_4.c" name="example3_4" title="Example 3.4" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_4.png"></p>

<p>First change is the inclusion of two utility functions (str_compare and str_find) 
that will be used to implement Find and are not object of this tutorial. If you 
want to understand what is inside these functions take a closer look into the 
code.</p>
<p>Then you will notice that several functions had their names changed from the 
previous example code. We did that to illustrate the importance of function 
nomenclature in a larger project, so that several callbacks can be easily 
associated with their respective control. For instance, open_cb became 
item_open_action_cb, saveas_cb became item_saveas_action_cb, and so on.</p>
<p>Allow me to make a jump in our code and please refer now to 
the item_find_action_cb function. This callback, despite been almost at the end of the code, 
is responsible to build one of our custom dialogs. In this dialog we will use some 
elements that we already saw in previous sessions: a text field to receive the 
string that the user wants to find, a button to find the next occurrence of this 
string, a button to close our find dialog, and two new IUP elements:
<a href="../elem/iuptoggle.html"><strong>IupToggle</strong></a> and
<a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>IupFill</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="../elem/iuptoggle.html"><strong>IupToggle</strong></a> is a 
two-state (on/off) button that, when selected, execute a callback. Toggles are 
normally used to set flags. In this case, we used it to allow the user to decide 
if the search will be case sensitive or not.</p>
<p><a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>IupFill</strong></a> is a very 
peculiar element. It is, as the name says, used to fill blank spaces inside our 
dialog. Or, in other words, to position and align IUP elements. The best way to 
understand IupFill is to think in it as a coil spring. If you put a
<a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>IupFill</strong></a>, inside a
<a href="../elem/iuphbox.html"><strong>IupHbox</strong></a>, between to elements 
it will expand pushing one to the left and the other to the right. Or if you put 
it, in a <a href="../elem/iupvbox.html"><strong>IupVbox</strong></a>, above a 
element, it will push the element all the way down. But IupFill also has a SIZE 
attribute, that can be used to control how much space will be taken. With experience we will 
find the correct way to define SIZES for <a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>
IupFill</strong></a> and for other elements as well. In our case,
<a href="../elem/iupfill.html"><strong>IupFill</strong></a> is been used to push 
button Find Next and button Close to the right inside our hbox.</p>
<p>Note that our new dialog has a lot of new parameters set. DIALOGFRAME 
will remove minbox, maxbox and resize from the corner of the dialog, this will 
provide a reduced functionality and an standard dialog box appearance. 
DEFAULTENTER defines a button to be activated when the users presses ENTER, in 
this case it will have the same effect of pressing the next_bt button. 
DEFAULTESC works the same way for the ESC key activating the close_bt button. 
Next the attribute PARENTALDIALOG is setting the dialog that holds item_find 
(our main dialog) as the parent of our new dialog, by using
<a href="../func/iupgetdialog.html"><strong>IupGetDialog</strong></a> which 
returns the handle of the dialog that contains the element passed as parameter. 
This will maintain the Find dialog always on top of the main dialog even if we 
change the focus to the main dialog. It will also allow us to set the find 
dialog position at the center of the parent dialog.</p>
<p>In the next two lines we use custom attributes to store application pointers. 
Each IUP element can hold as many custom attributes as you want. If your 
application needs to store some information to be retrieved later, you can just 
set it as we are doing here. We created a new attribute called MULTITEXT in the dialog to store the multitext element pointer and make it available to other callbacks. 
Doing this we avoid the global attribute used in the previous example. Also, we created another new attribute called FIND_DIALOG in 
the element find_item 
so we will able to reuse this dialog. For all the times this function is called 
the dialog is not created again, it is created only once.</p>
<p>Next we show our dialog using <a href="../func/iupshowxy.html"><strong>IupShowXY</strong></a> 
and pass IUP_CURRENT to it. This will center the dialog according to its 
parent (main dialog as we defined above) in the first time and reuse the last 
position in the next time since the dialog will not be destroyed when closed.</p>
<p>Now that we have built the Find dialog, its time to write the callbacks that 
will effectively do the job to find the string inside our multitext. </p>
<p>Let's turn our attention to the find_next_action_cb callback. This callback 
is responsible to find the next occurrence of our string inside the multitext and 
has a lot new function calls. We made a call to
<a href="../func/iupgetdialogchild.html"><strong>IupGetDialogChild</strong></a>. 
This function returns the identifier of the child element that has the NAME 
attribute in the same dialog hierarchy. We use it to retrieve the multitext 
handle. This is a more elegant form to retrieve handles instead of using a 
custom attribute or making a global variable, but it works only for the same 
dialog. The we retrieve the text to be found and the case sensitive flag from 
the respective controls. The search is performed and if the result is positive 
we will save the last found position in a custom attribute, and a call to
<a href="../func/iupsetfocus.html"><strong>IupSetFocus</strong></a>. When we 
showed our Find dialog we moved the focus from our multitext to the new dialog. 
This function is restoring the focus to the multitext. We then selects the text 
on the multitext. Next we find two calls to
<a href="../func/iuptextconvertpostolincol.html"><strong>
IupTextConvertPosToLinCol</strong></a> and
<a href="../func/iuptextconvertlincoltopos.html"><strong>
IupTextConvertLinColToPos</strong></a>. They are used to compute the position we 
use to scroll the multitext so the selection becomes visible.</p>
<p>Beside next_bt, find dialog also has close_bt and it also demands a callback. 
Find_close_action_cb closes the Find dialog. In this callback we made a 
call to <a href="../func/iuphide.html"><strong>IupHide</strong></a>. When a 
dialog is hidden, it is not destroyed, so you can show it again.</p>
<p>The Go To dialog will work in the same way. If you understood how to 
create the Find dialog you should be able to build the Go To dialogs.</p>

<h3>3.5 <a name="Toolbar_Statusbar">Adding a Toolbar and a Statusbar</a></h3>
<p>Now that we already saw how to use predefined dialogs or how to build our own 
dialogs, lets see how to implement two other resources present in many other 
applications: toolbars and status bars.</p>
<p>Toolbars are a set of buttons, usually positioned, side by side, in the top 
of the dialog, just bellow the menu. To build our toolbar we will use the attribute IMAGE 
of <a href="../elem/iupbutton.html"><strong>IupButton</strong></a>. As in 
predefined dialogs, IUP also offers a series of predefined images to be used with 
buttons. This images are part of a additional library called
<a href="../iupimagelib.html"><strong>IupImageLib</strong></a>. To use this 
library you should call <strong>IupImageLibOpen</strong> right after
<a href="../func/iupopen.html"><strong>IupOpen</strong>.</p>
</a>
<p>Statusbars normally appear in the bottom of the dialog and usually show some information 
about what is happening inside the application. To build our statusbar we will 
use a set of <a href="../elem/iuplabel.html"><strong>IupLabel</strong></a> 
controls arranged side by side. In our statusbar we will be displaying the 
caret position in the text and to achieve this we will use the IupText callback 
called CARET_CB that is called every time the caret position is changed. </p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_5.c">example3_5.c</a></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example3_5.c" name="example3_5" title="Example 3.5" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_5.png"></p>

<p>The first change, as told above, is the inclusion of multitext_caret_cb to our 
callbacks. In this callback we will make use of the parameter received by the 
callback. First we retrieve the handle of <a href="../elem/iuplabel.html">
<strong>IupLabel</strong></a> called lbl_statusbar using
<a href="../func/iupgetdialogchild.html"><strong>IupGetDialogChild</strong></a> 
passing the handle ih which came as a parameter of our callback. Next, we set 
the label's TITLE by building 
a string using lin and col parameters where the callback provides the caret line 
and column position. </p>
<p>From this new callback we will jump to main function where the next change 
appears. Just after IupOpen you will find a call to <a href="../iupimglib.html"><strong>IupImageLibOpen</strong></a>. This function 
will load the image library, so we can use its images in our toolbar.</p>
<p>A few lines after we will find our lbl_statusbar declaration. This label will 
play the role of our status bar. It needs the EXPAND attribute set to HORIZONTAL 
so it will occupy all the horizontal space inside the vbox. Following we will see some button declarations 
(btn_open, btn_save and btn_find) and some calls to
<a href="../func/iupsetattribute.html"><strong>IupSetAttribute</strong></a> 
setting each buttons image. The images names can be found at
the
<a href="../iupimagelib.html"><strong>IupImageLib</strong></a> documentation. Then we notice 
that our toolbar is nothing more than a <a href="../elem/iuphbox.html"><strong>
IupHbox</strong></a> containing those buttons. Note, a few lines after, that we 
set the buttons callbacks to the same callbacks set for the respective menu items. This is 
feasible 
because the buttons do exactly the same thing as the items just representing a 
short way to call open, save or find. We also set the FLAT attribute for the 
buttons so their border is removed and they will look like toolbar buttons.</p>
<p>The final change will be the inclusion of toolbar_hb and lbl_statusbar in the vbox 
that already had our multitext. The toolbar comes first because its a vbox and we 
want it above the multitext. lbl_statusbar goes after because we want it bellow the 
multitext. That's all. Our application now has both a toolbar and a status bar. 
In the next section we will improve it even more adding hot keys to our menus.</p>
<h3>3.6 Defining <a name="Hot_Keys">Hot Keys</a></h3>
<p>Applications that has menus always present hotkeys to its users. IUP also 
offers this resource. To define a hotkey you could use
<a href="../elem/iupdialog.html"><strong>IupDialog</strong></a>'s callback
<a href="../call/iup_k_any.html"><strong>K_ANY</strong></a>. This is a callback 
common to a lot of IUP elements and is called when a keyboard event occur. IUP 
also offers a simple way that allow you to define a specific callback for the 
key combination you want to deal with. For example if you want to show the file 
Open selection dialog when the user presses Ctrl+O then you just set a callback called 
"K_cO".
<a href="../attrib/key.html"><strong>Keyboard Codes</strong></a> shows a 
complete table with all keyboard codes available in IUP.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_6.c">example3_6.c</a></p>

<p>This example has not changed much. We just add "\tCtr+?" to each menu item 
that has a hotkey. Character "\t" will take care of aligining our hotkey text to the 
right and the rest of the string just tells the user which key combinations to 
press. Note that "?" should replaced by the key you want.</p>
<p>A few lines after we did a few calls to IupSetCallback using key combinations 
as callback names mentioned above to deal with key pressed events. That's all we need to change to include hotkeys in our application.</p>
<p>Since we are improving the user keyboard experience, there is another feature 
that we can use to aid users. Using the ampersand (&amp;) character in the menu item 
text we define a key that can activate the menu item. The next character 
following the ampersand will be the key. The main menu is reached using the 
Alt+key combination, for instance Alt+F will activate the File menu, once the 
menu is opened, use the 'O' key to activate the file Open menu item. Another 
example is the Alt+F then 'X' key combination to exit the application, many 
applications have this key combination enabled.</p>

<h3>3.7 <a name="Recent_Config">Recent Files Menu and a Configuration File</a> </h3>
<p>Many text editors offer a menu item that holds a list of recent files. We are 
going to use a IUP resource called <a href="../func/iupconfig.html"><strong>
IupConfig</strong></a> to implement this list and also store other configuration 
variables. IupConfig implements a group of functions to load, store and save 
application configuration variables. For example, the list of Recent Files, the 
last position and size of a dialog, last used parameters in dialogs, etc. Each 
variable has a key name, a value and a group that it belongs to.</p>
<p>Its important to remember that using <a href="../func/iupconfig.html">
<strong>IupConfig</strong></a> demands the inclusion of header file iup_config.h.</p>

<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_7.c">example3_7.c</a></p>
<iframe src="../../examples/tutorial/example3_7.c" name="example3_7" title="Example 3.7" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">
</iframe>
<p class="example_image"><img alt="" src="example3_7.png"></p>

<p>Note that in this new example we have included the iup_config.h header as 
advised above. We are going to start this analysis from our main function. After 
creating a handle for our config by calling
<a href="../func/iupconfig.html"><strong>IupConfig</strong></a>, we set the 
attribute APP_NAME. This attribute defines the name of our configuration file. 
In UNIX, the filename will be "<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tahoma, verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&lt;HOME&gt;/.&lt;APP_NAME&gt;</span>", where "<HOME><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tahoma, verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&lt;HOME&gt;</span>" is replaced by the "HOME" environment variable 
contents, and <APP_NAME> 
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tahoma, verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
&lt;APP_NAME&gt; </span>replaced by the APP_NAME attribute value. In Windows, 
the filename will be "<HOMEDRIVE><HOMEPATH><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tahoma, verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&lt;HOMEDRIVE&gt;&lt;HOMEPATH&gt;\&lt;APP_NAME&gt;.cfg</span>", 
where HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH are also obtained from environment variables. </p>
<p>Then comes a call to <strong>IupConfigLoad</strong> that will load our config 
file at startup. This function combined with the <strong>IupConfigSave</strong> 
function, that we will see later, will allow our configuration variables to be 
persistent between different application executions. </p>
<p>Following, a few lines bellow, we create the recent_menu that will hold our 
recent items inside. You will see that it works as any other menu creation 
except by the fact we will not add any menu items. They will be 
provided by a function that we will see soon. We positioned our recent_menu above the 
item_exit menu item and bellow the <a href="../elem/iupseparator.html">
<strong>IupSeparator</strong></a>.</p>
<p>After the menu is created there is call to <strong>IupConfigRecentInit</strong>. This function is 
responsible to initialize the recent_menu items from the configuration file 
entries. The item_recent_cb callback will be called when the user selects 
a file in the recent list. And the function also defines the number of recent files what will be 
stored and displayed. In our example we choose to store 10 files. Also note that both item_open_cb and item_saveas_cb should change the recent 
files list. So a call to <strong>IupConfigRecentUpdate</strong> is necessary to 
maintain our 
recent files list updated.</p>
<p>Next line shows a call to <strong>IupConfigDialogShow</strong> that replaces 
<strong>IupShow/IupShowXY</strong>. This function will also show the dialog but 
it will try to use the last 
position and size stored in the configuration file. It can be used for any 
application dialog, just use different names for each dialog.</p>
<p>The function <strong>IupConfigDialogClosed</strong> is used to save the last dialog position and 
size when the dialog is about to be closed, usually inside the dialog CLOSE_CB 
callback or when the dialog is programmatically hidden. The CLOSE_CB callback is called when the user clicks on the dialog close button, usually a 
'X' at the top right corner of the dialog. Here our dialog is closed by the item_exit_action_cb 
callback, so we decided to also use this function as the CLOSE_CB callback and to call <strong>IupConfigDialogClosed</strong>. 
Finally, since this callback also exists the application we use it to call
<strong>IupConfigSave</strong> that will 
save our configuration file, and now that it is saved we can destroy its handle 
using <strong>IupDestroy</strong>.</p>
<p>That's all for the main function so let's turn our attention to the item_recent_cb callback. This callback, as said before, is 
responsible for handling the selection of a recent file at the menu_recent. Inside 
it, we recover our config handle from a custom attribute in the dialog, then we get the file name 
from the TITLE attribute of item_recent and open it the same way we do in item_open_cb.</p>

<h3>3.8 <a name="Clipboard">Clipboard</a> Support</h3>

<p>Following we will find some callbacks that handle copy, cut, paste, delete and select all 
of new items added to the Edit menu and a callback to
manage activation and deactivation of these items. All are very short callbacks.</p>

<p>item_copy_action_cb, item_paste_action_cb and item_cut_action_cb use a resource called <A href="../elem/iupclipboard.html">
<strong>IupClipboard</strong></a> which creates an element that allows access to the clipboard. Each <A href="../elem/iupclipboard.html">
<strong>IupClipboard</strong></a> should be destroyed using <A href="../func/iupdestroy.html"><strong>IupDestroy</strong></a>. You can use 
only one for the entire application because it does not store any data inside, or you can simply create and destroy every time you need to 
copy or paste, that's how we did in our notepad. The item_copy_action_cb callback retrieves the SELECTEDTEXT attribute from our multitext 
and sets the clipboard TEXT attribute to copy the text selection. item_paste_action_cb retrieves the clipboard TEXT attribute and insert 
it (paste) in the multitext, where the cursor is positioned, using the INSERT attribute. item_cut_action_cb is almost the same code as copy except 
by the fact that it sets attribute SELECTEDTEXT to "" removing the selected text from the 
multitext. item_delete_action_cb does the same as 
cut, but without using the clipboard. item_select_all_cb just set the attribute SELECTION to ALL 
selecting all the text inside the multitext.
</p>

<p>Another callback was created to deal with the initialization of our new menu items. edit_menu_open_cb is associated to the edit_menu 
OPEN_CB callback. It will set the cut, paste, copy and delete items as active or inactive depending on some conditions. First 
it is
necessary to obtain the handles of these items. We use the NAME attribute of each item 
and the <strong><a href="../func/iupgetdialogchild.html">IupGetDialogChild</a></strong> function for this propose, just like 
we did before for the multitext. Then we test if there is text available in the clipboard calling
<a href="../func/iupgetattributes.html">
<strong>IupGetInt</strong></a>(clipboard, "TEXTAVAILABLE"). Its a short way to test a boolean return value without having to compare strings 
with "YES" or "NO". So, if it returns 0 means there is no text in the clipboard, or in other words, there is nothing to paste. Item paste then
should be disable setting ACTIVE to "NO". Otherwise, the user should be able to paste and we should set ACTIVE to "YES". The other items follow 
the same idea but this time checking the content of the attribute SELECTEDTEXT. If there is nothing selected, disable cut, copy and delete 
items. Otherwise, enable all items.</p>

<h3>3.9 <a name="More_File_Management">More File Management</a> (Drag&amp;Drop, Command Line, 
...)</h3>

<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Falta</strong>: Aproveitar o gancho da 
MENUOPEN_CB para acrescentar open/exit/new save check, ai acrescentar File New, File Save 
(não mostra dialogo, botão passa usar essa callback), e de quebra File name no TITLE, DROPFILES_CB, argv[1]. 
Usar VALUE_CHANGED_CB para verificar se o arquivo lido ou novo, foi modificado.

<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Falta</strong>: complementar item 3.10 com 
detalhes da implementação<p class="example_title">Example Source Code: <a href="../../examples/tutorial/example3_9.c">example3_9.c</a></p>

<h3>3.10 Dynamic Layout</h3>
<p>Now we would like to be able to hide and show some of the complementary 
dialog elements such as the Toolbar and the Statusbar. If you simply set their 
VISIBLE attribute to NO they will be hidden, but their size in the dialog layout 
will still be reserved and an empty space will be displayed instead. To avoid 
that we use the FLOATING attribute along with the VISIBLE attribute so they will 
be hidden and its space will be used by the multitext.</p>
<p>To implement that feature we added a new submenu called "View" at the main 
menu with two new items. One for controlling the Toolbar visibility and another 
for controlling the Statusbar visibility. And we use the IupConfig to store this 
selection to be persistent between different application executions. </p>

<h3>3.11 External Help</h3>
<p>One additional feature that our text editor can have is an external help. IUP 
shows an external help by simply calling the <a href="../func/iuphelp.html">
IupHelp</a> function. It will show an internet browser in the given page so the 
application can display some documentation to the user. In our example, it is 
just a menu item that activates the item_help_action_cb callback which calls the <strong>IupHelp</strong> function. 
This function shows the IUP website, but it can also show a local HTML file. In Windows, that function is even more flexible allowing to 
open any kind of document provided that it is associated with an application.</p>

<h3>3.12 <a name="Final_Considerations">Final Considerations</a></h3>

<p>That's all for chapter three. If you reached this lines then you are be able to 
build a simple but fully featured Notepad application using lots of IUP 
resources. </p>
<p>During this chapter we went from 30 lines of code to 1100 lines. Just for our 
simple notepad with file read and write, clipboard access, text search, and other 
features. </p>

<p>For our final code of the simple notepad, we just added two missing features: 
Replace, and Find Next using a hot key. Plus some code organization and 
comments. Any contribution to this code is welcome. Please, send us your 
comments and suggestions.</p>
