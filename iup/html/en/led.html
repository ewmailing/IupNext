<h2 align="center" style="text-align:center">LED</h2>
<p>LED is a dialog-specification language whose purpose is not to be a complete 
programming language, but rather to make dialog specification simpler than in C. </p>
<p>In LED, attributes and expressions follow this form:</p>
<pre>name = element[attribute1=value1,attribute2=value2<b>,</b>...](expression)</pre>
<p>The element must not contain the “iup” prefix. Attribute values 
are always interpreted as strings, but they need to be in quotes (“…” or '...') only when 
they include spaces. </p>
<p>Expressions are mandatory and contain parameters for creating 
the element.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p>Each element constructor has a different set of parameters, see each 
element documentation.</u1:p></p>
<p>In LED there is no distinction between upper and lower case, except for 
attribute values.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
<u1:p></u1:p>
</p>
<p>
<u1:p>To insert line breaks in string values use '\n'. The LED file itself can 
contain line breaks in DOS or Windows format, not in Mac format.</u1:p></p>
<p>
<u1:p>Comments start with the '#' character and goes all the way until the end 
of the line.</u1:p></p>
<p>
Also<u1:p> there is no NULL definition, but containers can be empty (since 
3.28).</u1:p></p>
<p>The <a href="func/iupload.html">IupLoad</a> function can parse a text file and create 
the IUP elements defined in it. Naturally, the same file cannot be loaded more 
than once, because the elements would be created again. The file parse 
does not map the elements to the native system, but it does create those 
elements.</p>
<p>LED files can be dynamically loaded by the application and must be packaged together with the 
application’s executable. However, this often becomes an inconvenience. To deal 
with it, there is the 
<a href="ledc.html">LEDC</a> compiler that creates a C module from the LED 
contents. </p>
<p>To simply view a LED file objects use the LED Viewer application called 
	<a href="executables.html">IupView</a>, in the applications included in the distribution.
  <u1:p>Pre-compiled binaries are available at the <a href="download.html">Download</a>.</u1:p></p>
